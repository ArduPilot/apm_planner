This docker can be used to build apm-planner and create an APM-Planner AppImage which should be able to run on several liux distributions.

It is a ubuntu 16.04 based container using latest Qt 5.12.

Simpy start the BuildPlanner.sh script. It will do all the work for you.
As this tooling uses docker you should have a working docker installation.
