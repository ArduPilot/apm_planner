 * \anchor faq-non-QIODevice Q. Is there any way to use QuaZipFile in Qt
 * where you are supposed to use normal (non-zipped) file, but not
 * through QIODevice API?
 *
 * A. Usually not. For example, if you are passing file name to some
 * database driver (like SQLite), Qt usually just passes this name down
 * to the 3rd-party library, which is usually does not know anything
 * about QIODevice and therefore there is no way to pass QuaZipFile as
 * normal file. However, if we are talking about some place where you
 * pass file name, and then indirectly use QFile to open it, then it is
 * a good idea to make overloaded method, which accepts a QIODevice
 * pointer. Then you would be able to pass QuaZipFile as well as many
 * other nice things such as QBuffer or QProcess.
 *
 * \anchor faq-zip64 Q. Can QuaZIP handle files larger than 4GB? What
 * about zip64 standard?
 *
 * A. It isn't supported yet. QuaZIP is a wrapper around minizip. The minizip
 * version QuaZIP was based on didn't support zip64. The newer version
 * that appeared around 2010 reportedly does. But it will take some time
 * and effort to integrate this version with QuaZIP.
