Documentation

Mac OS X
========

To build on Mac OS X (10.6 or later):

Install SDL
-----------
1) Download SDL from:  <http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-1.2.14.dmg>

2) From the SDL disk image, copy the `sdl.framework` bundle to `/Library/Frameworks` directory (if you are not an admin copy to `~/Library/Framewroks`)

Install QT
-----------
1) Download Qt 4.8.x (Does not current work with Qt5.x)

2) Double click the package installer

Build APM Planner
--------------------
1) From the terminal go to the `apm_planner` directory created when you cloned the repository.

2) Run `qmake -spec macx-g++ qgroundcontrol.pro`

3) Run `make -j8`


Linux 
=====

Building on Linux (tested against Ubuntu 13.10):

1) Install the required packages:

```
sudo apt-get install phonon libqt4-dev libqt4-opengl-dev \
 libphonon-dev libphonon4 phonon-backend-gstreamer \
 qtcreator libsdl1.2-dev libflite1 flite1-dev build-essential \
 libopenscenegraph-dev libssl-dev libqt4-opengl-dev libudev-dev 
```

2) Clone the repository in your workspace:

```
cd ~/workspace
git clone https://github.com/diydrones/apm_planner
```

3) Build APM Planner:

```
cd ~/workspace/apm_planner
qtmake-qt4 qgroundcontrol.pro
make
```

Or try `qmake qgroundcontrol.pro` if the `qtmake-qt4` command doesn't exist on your version of Ubuntu.

4) Run APM Planner:

```
./release/apmplanner2
```

5) Permanent installation (optional, if you'd like to install APM Planner in a fixed location)
 
There are two ways to do this:
a) You can build a .deb using ```scripts/LinuxBuildPackage.sh```, and then install the deb via ```dpkg -i ~/Documents/APMPlanner2-$NOW.deb``` (where $NOW is today's date). This should add it to your launcher too.

b) Alternatively, run ```sudo make install```. This will place the binary in your /bin/ folder and corresponding files in /share/.

Windows
=======

GNU GCC / MINGW IS UNTESTED, COULD WORK
VISUAL STUDIO 2008 / 2010 EXPRESS EDITION IS FREE!

Steps for Visual Studio 2008 / 2010:

Windows XP/7:

1) Download and install the Qt libraries for Windows from https://qt.nokia.com/downloads/ (the Visual Studio 2008 or 2010 version as appropriate)

2) Download and install Visual Studio 2008 or 2010 Express Edition (free) from https://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio. If using Visual Studio 2010, make sure you are running at least SP1. There is a linking error you'll encounter otherwise that will prevent compilation.

3) Go to the QGroundControl folder and then to thirdParty/libxbee and build it following the instructions in win32.README

4) Open the Qt Command Prompt program (should be in the Start Menu), navigate to the source folder of QGroundControl and create the Visual Studio project by typing:

`qmake -tp vc qgroundcontrol.pro`

5) Now start Visual Studio and load the qgroundcontrol.vcproj if using Visual Studio 2008 or qgroundcontrol.vcxproj if using Visual Studio 2010

6) Compile and edit in Visual Studio. If you need to add new files, add them to qgroundcontrol.pro and re-run `qmake -tp vc qgroundcontrol.pro`
