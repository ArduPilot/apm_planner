This is a slightly modified version of apm_planner that will be compiled on an ARM board using a modified version of qt4 (as double). The qt4 branch compiles fine with the modified qt4 but since we wanted to add freenect support we needed to change a few minor things. 

We compiled in qtcreator 2.0.1 and qt4.8.7 using qmake-qt4 on Ubunutu 12.04

I don't know what happens when you use these modified files with OSX or Windows so I will remove those instructions. I have also remove the qt4 and openscene dependecies because we will assume that you are using qt4 compiled as a double and openscene isn't officially supports in 12.04. 


**Note: I have libusbx installed on top of libusb. Libusbx is deprecated and merged into libusb but libusb (newer) wouldn't let me see my Kinect sensor. This may be needed but I'm not sure.

Linux 
=====

Building on Linux (tested against Ubuntu 13.10):

1) Install the required packages:

```
sudo apt-get install phonon libqt4-opengl-dev \
 libphonon-dev libphonon4 phonon-backend-gstreamer \
 qtcreator libsdl1.2-dev libflite1 flite1-dev build-essential \
 libssl-dev libqt4-opengl-dev libudev-dev \
 libsndfile1-dev libqt4-sql-sqlite
```

2) Clone the repository in your workspace:

```
cd ~/workspace
git clone https://github.com/diydrones/apm_planner
```

3) Build APM Planner:

```
cd ~/workspace/apm_planner
qmake-qt4 qgroundcontrol.pro
make
```

Or try `qmake qgroundcontrol.pro` if the `qmake-qt4` command doesn't exist on your version of Ubuntu. This will only work if the Qt version install on your machine is Qt4.8.x, this can be checked using `qmake -v'

4) Run APM Planner:

```
./release/apmplanner2
```

5) Permanent installation (optional, if you'd like to install APM Planner in a fixed location)
 
There are two ways to do this:
a) You can build a .deb using ```scripts/LinuxBuildPackage.sh```, and then install the deb via ```dpkg -i ~/Documents/APMPlanner2-$NOW.deb``` (where $NOW is today's date). This should add it to your launcher too.

b) Alternatively, run ```sudo make install```. This will place the binary in your /bin/ folder and corresponding files in /share/.
