Now there should be one and only one checked checkbox, which shows the last KNOWN "current" waypoint on MAV. The white border around an unchecked checkbox means, that the user is requesting the change of current waypoint, but QGC has not received MISSION_CURRENT message as a confirmation yet.

  [ pixhawk ]

  [ PIXHAWK Team ]
  * Arrow key control

  [ LM ]
  * Formatting, fixing audio alarms

  [ Bryant Mairs ]
  * Refactored part of MAVLinkProtocol::receiveBytes() as I was trying to debug within it. Nothing major, though I did remove an unnecessary loop.
  * Added a workaround to the mission management code where it would only accept messages addressed to the MAV_ID_MISSIONPLANNER component. This was causing problems with the send-loss value being calculated, so I decided to add this until a proper solution can be developed.

  [ LM ]
  * Re-enabled double UDP port usage, substantially improved setpoint sending

  [ pixhawk ]
  * Mission Plan: "autocontinue"-checkbox in view-tab is no longer interactive, because MAVLINK protocol does not support online "autocontinue" switching yet.

  [ hengli ]
  * Major overhaul of local 3D view: now supports multi-MAV visualization.

  [ Bryant Mairs ]

  [ hengli ]
  * Fixed bug in bird's eye view in 3D view.
  * Minor GUI flaws fixed. Visualize links between poses from different component sources for each MAV.
  * Disabled mouse-based throwing movement of camera in 3D view.

  [ Tobias Simon ]
  * increased GPS sat timeout from 1 second to 10 seconds sending GPS sat information via a low-bandwidth link like the UM96 @ 9600 baud should also work at low frequencies like 0.2 Hz

  [ Bryant Mairs ]
  * Exposed HEARTBEAT.system_status and HEARTBEAT.base_mode to the realtime plotter widget via the valueChanged signal.

  [ TobiasSimon ]
  * fixes segfault when starting QGC without having a UAS selected

  [ Bryant Mairs ]
  * Added logging of useful values from the HEARTBEAT and SYS_STATUS messages to the realtime plotter. Removed some dead code. Added more valueChanged() signals to account for every data type. This moves the conversion over into the valueChanged receivers, which while it will require more slot-functions, makes it easier to add more code as any necessary conversion is done internally to the slot and so the signaler doesn't need to know the details. I also added some more details on the types of units expected by valueChanged().

  [ TobiasSimon ]
  * fixed out-of-order bug in packet loss calculation
  * fixed debug output and removed tab indents
  * symptom: heartbeat Hz value was always 0 cause: check for null pointer had no effect (static memory) solution: fill mavlink messages (and thus) message type with 0xff. this patch assumes that message ID 0xff is never used positiv side effect: qgroundcontrol uses 2% less cpu on my machine (eeepc)
  * Added emits for gps and controller flags in HSI window

  * Canceling out of file selection in the logfile plotter no longer triggers a warning.
  * Added a check for a division by zero in AbstractCalibrator::logAverage(). This was causing a crash when attempting a calibration when there's no RC data being received.

  [ Lorenz Meier ]
  * Adding waypoints also works without position

  [ Bryant Mairs ]
  * Fixed a stack overflow bug when using the regression fitting command in logfile plot. Solution involved just allocating on the heap instead of the stack.

  * Updated bundled generator for 1.0
  * Updated MAVLink to most recent

  [ Bryant Mairs ]

  * Fixed a couple of uninitialized arrays within the MAVLinkDecoder. It would result in weird time values in some data logging instances.
  * Fixed improper capitalization in UI.
  * Refactored the LogCompressor. It wasn't properly handling certain message logging files that mixed messages (Issue #70). One note is that this logger should work correctly as I've tested it, but could have some edge cases. It is pickier about the file format that it will sparse, but I don't know if the error-checking stuff from the old code would have actually worked. This can also be easily re-added.
  * Fixed the qgcunittest.pro build process. TODO: This should be altered to reuse stuff from qgroundcontrol.pro by including it instead of copy/paste.
  * Updated QGC unit testing build script. It now builds properly (on Windows at least). I had to update some method calls in UASUnitTest.cc. I'd bet that some of the tests are wrong now because of it.
  * Removed unnecessary test files.
  * Removed some dead/unnecessary code from UASUnitTest.h.
