  * Merge branch 'master' of github.com:diydrones/apm_planner

  [ 2015-10-21  Bill Bonney  <billbonney@communistech.com> ]
  * Build: Release 2.0.19-rc4

  [ 2015-10-20  Bill Bonney  <billbonney@communistech.com> ]

  [ 2015-10-13  Peter Barker  <pbarker@barker.dropbear.id.au> ]
  * AP2DataPlot2DModel: corrections to facilitate export of data to .log
  * Several fixes:
  *  - FMTs don't appear to take an index slot
  *  - number of columns must be adjusted for idx and message type
  *  - a few missing format types added (not done exhaustively)

  [ 2015-10-12  Tomaz Canabrava  <tomaz.canabrava@intel.com> ]
  * UDP Link: Fixes #802 Dont use QObjects in different threads
  * The code added in 20f7b8f to workaround a Qt bug also created a new
  * issue: it constantly changed the thread that an object was created
  * without paying attention about the signal / slot connection nor the
  * thread ownership.

  * This code moves all object creation from within the UDPLink object
  * inside the UDPLink thread, and the communication for the thread
  * contol is done via boolean flags (_restart, _reconnect, _finish, etc
  * ) that the thread mainloop will certainly hit and do what is requested.

  * Since a single approach is usually better than two different approaches
  * because it's easier to spot a bug and fix it, I removed the
  * BROKEN_SIGNAL define that was used to create two very different
  * approaches of the code and used only the code that should work for the
  * BROKEN_SIGNAL case, since it also should work for the non-broken signal
  * ones.

  * Tested and there is no more crash because of broken UDP content,
  * connection and disconnection of the UDP link works, no more random
  * crashes on linux because of threads and UDP connection.

  [ 2015-10-02  Tomaz Canabrava  <tomaz.canabrava@intel.com> ]
  * Firmware Update: Fixes #814 infinite recursion while loading MainWindow v2
  * ApmFirmwareConfig triggered a timer to load the serialPorts
  * but that should be only populated when the interface is visible,
  * so I removed the timer call on the constructor.

  * Also, on the hideEvent of ApmFirmwareConfig we were unconditionally
  * trying to call MainWindow::instance(), and in some cases the first
  * call to ::instance() wasn't finished yet ( still on the MainWindow
  * constructor ) - so we should only act on the hideEvent if m_timer
  * is active.
